# Hongting Yin . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate of the University of Waterloo with a degree in Master of Engineering and my focus was on software development and data processing when I was pursuing my master's degree. I'm an enthusiastic and goal-oriented engineer with a passion for software and data engineering and project-based experience. I'm also a detail-oriented and dedicated team player with a 'can-do' attitude while teaming collaboration. During my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, traveling, and jogging.

## Development Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HongtingYin](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HongtingYin)

- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**: Developed a bash agent to monitor server hardware specifications and usage in real-time using Bash and SQL. Inserted collected data into a PostgreSQL database provisioned by docker. Wrote SQL queries to analyze server resource usage for Linux cluster planning and forecast.
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**: Programmed three Java applications using various libraries and tools. The Grep application is to search for a specific text pattern recursively in a given directory and output the matched lines to a file. This application was implemented using Java 8 Stream APIs and Lambda Expressions. The JDBC application allows developers to connect to a PostgreSQL database and implement CRUD operations using the DAO pattern. The third application is a Twitter CLI Java Application which is used to post, find, delete tweets. Designed the application with the MVC architecture. Tested the application using JUnit and Mockito libraries.
- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**: Developing a stock trading microservice by using SpringBoot. The application is able to access real-time market data from IEX Cloud and store the account information of a trader into a PostgreSQL database. It also use Swagger as an interface where users are able to operate their personal accounts and stock trading information.
- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)**: Not started
- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)**: Not started
- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)**:  Not started

## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer,  Jarvis, Toronto (2020-Present):** Worked on projects related to different topics in an Agile team. Developed an application by using Bash CLI and SQL and three applications based on MVC, Java libraries, and Spring framework. I will work on more projects about Big Data to improve my professional skills and knowledge. In this Agile team, I also worked with my coworkers as a team lead and helped them in the completion of projects and other problems.

## Education & Academic Projects

**University of Waterloo (2017-2019)**, Master of Engineering, Electrical & Computer Engineering

- **Stance Detection:** Compared the influence of four global features and evaluated the effects of global features by SVM, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Nive Bayes. Built CNNs models to classify the stance of each pair headline and text body. The best model achieves 92.5% weighted scores which is much higher than the baseline with a number of 78%.

**Henan University of Urban Construction (2011-2015)**, Bachelor of Electrical & Information Engineering

- **Detection of Microaneurysms:** Extracted information in the green channel and converted the image to a single channel. Compared the results of two image enhancement algorithms, Adapt-Histogram Equalization and Gamma Correction. Developed an effective method by Gamma correction combined with CNNs to detect MAs. Once the application finished completely, it can help doctors diagnosis potential diabetic patients and reduce the burden of the public health system.
